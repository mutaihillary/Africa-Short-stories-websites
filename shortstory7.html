        <h1>The Sign</h1>
        <p> I ought to  have understand,  I  did  not  to  choose  this  life it  chose  me.  My  childhood  had  somehow 
prepared  me  for  this  job 
–
if  you  can  call  it  a  job  that  is.  My  mother  had  the  same  job  and  her 
mother as well. I guess I couldn’t esca
pe it.
It’s a cold ev
ening, and it's around 7 pm. I’
m  sure  it  will  no
t  rain  today.  The  rain  cuts
business 
down 
almost 
to 
zero. You see, the street side is not a place to be during a downpour. The sky is a 
dark blue with a few stars spread out, that’s how
I know it will not rain. I’ve been told stars are a 
sure sign that the skies w
ill hold back
. 
Thank God! .  </p>
        <p>I’m wearing the white dress, the stretchy one that shows the curve of my hips cl
early. W
hite is a 
good colour when you’re trying to be noticed among 
several  other  girls,  especially  when  your 
co
mplexio
n  is  as  dark  as  mine.
M
y  make
-
up  has  been  applied.  My  mu
m  taught  me  how  to  wear 
make
-
up. Maroon lipstick
(red was for the light skinned ones) and a bit of eye shadow. I’m wearing 
six  inch  heels,  not  so  muc
h for fashion but more to be noticed easier. At 5’ 1”, I am one of the 
shorter girls here. I’m not wearing any underwear; I have learnt that sometimes the only way to get 
customers is to give a preview of what’s to come up and clean, short, fingernails. </p>
        <p>The fastened buttons of her button down shirt stop slightly above herbosom, giving me an ever so slight peep as she  heaves  in  subtle  anticipation.
        She  is  a  snob  though.  Earlier  on,  when  I  tried  to  greet  her  and introduce  myself,  she  had  politely  answered,  but  had  deliberately  refused  to  give  me  her  name, walking off instead and sitting at the other end of the table where she pretends to read a book. No one can convince me they can concentrate on a book while they wait for a lifealtering experience so she has to be pretending. </p><p> Then there is the breastfeeding chick. Not that she has come with a child to the job interview,but the tight knot around her chest attracts even more attention to the already lifted boobs, thanks to an obviously effective pushup bra. She keeps checking herself in her pocket mirror and adding layers and layers of grease to her lips. She might be bored, like all of us are in the waiting room but she definitely intends to rely heavily on her “bosom buddies” to nail the ob. Those boobs better do a good job today or I would hate to think what she will do to them if they fail her, I think to myself. I turn to my HTC and update my twitter status to: Had I known boobs played a big role in getting a job, I would have been born a woman. #WinningNotThe waiting room is down a long corridor, next to a conference hall with a big wooden door in which  the  written  and  oral  interviews  are  to  take  place.  The  room  is  portioned  off  with a glass screen and a sliding door. The glass has patterns on it, such that the people on the inside and those on  the  outside  can  see  figures  on  either  side  without  making  out  the  faces.  It  is  furnished  quite tastefully  with  black  sofas  and  a  glasstop  table  in  the  room’s  centre,topped  with  business magazines and profile pamphlets on the organisation conductng the interviewsthe Ministry. Six of us have just been herded into the room from the reception. We mumble greetings to the people who  are  next  to  us  in  the  line  and  attempt  to  look  for  comfortable  spots  in  theroom  which  can easily fit twenty people.I take the seat nearest to the entrance just in case I need to dash out,and also it can’t hurt to see all the people that want the job.The  profile  pamphlets  are  the  first  to  be  picked 
up 
and  like  hot,  meaty  bites  at  a  cocktail  party, 
they  go  fast.  One 
must  know  everything  they  can  about  the  company  they  want  to  work  for,  I 
guess. I pick one from the last two and begin to leaf through.
My reading is interrupted when 
a short, o
ld man in an oversized coat 
sweeps into the room. He 
says 
in 
a firm and loud 
voice, “Good morning everybody. How are you all today?” We all mumble 
unintelligible  things,  some  of  us  startled  out  of  our  private  worlds  by  his  commanding  presence. 
Due  to  his  air  of  authority,  if  I  had  not  seen  him  before  at  the  written  interview  we  had
in 
Namboole, I would have thought he already worked for the Ministry and had come to instruct us in 
the  next  step 
of  the  selection  process.
He  goes  ahead  and  pumps  some  hands,  sprinkling  more 
pleasantries as he jumps over people to reach those seated on t
he other side of the table
. They have 
already
warmed 
up 
their seats and refuse to leave their strategic vantage points</p>
