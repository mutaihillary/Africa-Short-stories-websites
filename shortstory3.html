    <body><h1>Legal Alien</h1>
        <p> I can’t believe the receptionist is not going to take my consultation fee just because I’m from her tribe!  I  thought  corruption  was  only  for  the  politicians  and  big  businessmen.  But  here,  in  a  small town clinic, I am going to be the beneficiary of a corrupt doctor’s receptionist. Is this a good thing or  a  bad  thing? Well, I don’t care right now. I have spent the day running around offices getting papers stamped. Now, I have to get a doctor to give me a check-up, approve this medical form, and stamp  it.  I  was  about  to  walk  out  of  this  clinic  because  the  consultation  fee  alone,  without  the medical check-upfee, was way too high. But then, the receptionist glimpsed my name on the form and said, “Eh, you mean you are from my village! Why didn’t you tell me your surname, I would have done you a favour.” Then she started chatting away in our language.  </p>
        <p>“If you had told me where you were from, I wouldn’t have told you to pay that high consultation fee. In fact, I’ve got enough for today, so don’t bother paying for consultation. Just wait for the patient  who  is  in  now  tocome  out  and  you  can  go  in  for  your check-up.” Thank goodness she sneaked  those  last  sentences  in  English.  She  started  rattling  on  in ur language  again.  I  dared  not inform her that I didn’t understand a single word she was saying. Today, was not going tobe  the day I revealed my excuse for not knowing my mother tongue. I will not reveal to her that I became aware of my vernacular deprivation in ‘93, when I was a child. Daddy had taken me to the classroom and left me there. I stopped sobbing when the teacher led me in. The room was so big! There were over a hundred children in there; at least seven pupils on each of the fifteen or so benches. The walls were dirty, and you could see where the blue paint had been chipped at by enthusiastic kids. There wereno cupboards, no teacher’s desk, no carpet, no sleeping corner, no tiles. The room held only children, benches, a cemented floor and a huge, old  blackboard  positioned  at  the  front.  Everything  was  so  dated.  It  was  as  if  the  décor  had  been inspired by an Adams Familyepisode.</p>
        <p>The  sweets  were  different  colours.  I  unwrapped  the  white vuvera, polythene  paper,  from  one  and  threw  it  in  my  mouth.  I  felt  thesticky  honey  sweetness fill my mouth and I swallowed. We ran past Joe’s house to reach  Katumba’s house so that he could taste the nsenene.  Kato  was panting. We wanted to tell Katumba the news quickly and run back home. Mummy didn’t want us playing with Katumba. She said he had bad manners; he liked playing with his male part in front of us. “Katumba,  our  aunt  came  from  Kampala,” Kato told him, from the cool shade where he was seated. He wasplucking the wings and the legs of nsenene</p>
        <p>At the back of the classroom, bags were sprawled all over the floor, since there were not enough hooks on the wall to carry them all. I looked up at the man who I assumed was the class teacher, as I’d heard my daddy address him as Mr.Muhangazima,  and asked, “Where is the fridge?”There were loud gasps and the class started laughing. I began to cry again. Mr.Muhangazima bent down and quietly said,“This is a classroom. We don’t keep fridges in classrooms. We don’t have a fridge in theschool,except the one in the canteen. Mpozi there’s a new one in the kitchen –”“But where will I keep my break time snacks?”“Just leave them in your bagand then put it at the back of the classroom.”</p>
