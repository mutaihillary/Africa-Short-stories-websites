        <h1>Pre-Naivasha Days</h1>
        <p> We used to fight flies and heat
In the bullet ridden grass thatched huts,
We lived in the hope of milk and honey.
We tried to share the little we got
with guerrilla forces
Who lived in hope too and tried
To survive with little
or
no food and water
Tyre sandals for shoes
and old
clothes l
ooted or donated.
The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement united us. 
Yes! We were united: together, Army and ordinary Citizens.
We decorated our bodies with ostrich feathers;
We danced and smiled, we laughed and celebrated
Together, we ate, 
together we drank,
Together we poured libations to bless the spirits
Of the fallen heroes buried or abandoned.  </p>
        <p>The Guerrilla Generals
-
turned
-
Politicians
Cruised the V
-
8 vehicles in our new dustbowl
They swim amidst ill
-
hooked wealth,
Cool Juba heat with 
the air conditioners
Chilling out of the newly furnished
Bungalows and palaces.
.</p>
        <p>We fight flies and fan off
the airless heat in congested
Tin roofed shelters without ceiling boards
And
ventilated window
-
after Naivasha Days.</p>
