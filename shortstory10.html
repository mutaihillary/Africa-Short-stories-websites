    <body><h1>Pre-Naivasha Days</h1>
        <p> We used to fight flies and heat
In the bullet ridden grass thatched huts,
We lived in the hope of milk and honey.
We tried to share the little we got
with guerrilla forces
Who lived in hope too and tried
To survive with little

and old

We decorated our bodies with ostrich feathers;
We danced and smiled, we laughed and celebrated
Together, we ate,

Together we poured libations to bless the spirits
Of the fallen heroes buried or abandoned.  </p>

Cool Juba heat with

Chilling out of the newly furnished
Bungalows and palaces.

        <p>We fight flies and fan off
the airless heat in congested
Tin roofed shelters without ceiling boards
And
ventilated window
