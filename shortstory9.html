    <body><h1>At 84</h1>
        <p> Your teeth have fled their nest.
Dust rules over the Holy Book.
Untouched buttons of your radio look on.
Curtain folds are like a nurse’s starched uniform.
Your 
soup bowl has become a roach’s pool.
Your appetite is painted in dull colours.
Your walking stick is the centre in the spider’s handcraft.
Vivacity basks in a second childhood.
The sturdy voice that bounced on walls is now drained.
The kite .  </p>
        <p>I’m wearing the white dress, the stretchy one that shows the curve of my hips cl
early. W
hite is a 
good colour when you’re trying to be noticed among 
several  other  girls,  especially  when  your 
co
mplexio
n  is  as  dark  as  mine.

up  has  been  applied.  My  mu
m  taught  me  how  to  wear 
make
.</p>
        <p>sharp eyesight 
simmers on dying fire.
Your countenance is the light of a fast sinking sun.
Muscles of steel now soft like newly ground corn.
Humour has abandoned your garden.
Where are the mighty hands that lifted me when I fell?
Silent weeds strangle years.
Tendrils of 
life are tangled up and bewildered.
Your worm</p>
        <p>eaten garb sways in the wind.
My eyes well up and rage weighs my throat down.
You are the mahogany never meant to shed his leaves</p>
