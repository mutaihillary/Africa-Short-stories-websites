                            <h1>At 84</h1>
                            <p> Your teeth have fled their nest.<br>
                    Dust rules over the Holy Book.<br>
                    Untouched buttons of your radio look on.<br>
                    Curtain folds are like a nurse’s starched uniform.<br>
                    Your soup bowl has become a roach’s pool.<br>
                    Your appetite is painted in dull colours.<br>
                    Your walking stick is the centre in the spider’s handcraft.<br>
                    Vivacity basks in a second childhood.<br>
                    The sturdy voice that bounced on walls is now drained.<br>
                      </p>
                            <p>I’m wearing the white dress,<br>
                                The stretchy one that shows the curve of my hips clearly.<br>
                                White is a 
                    good colour when you’re trying to be noticed among 
                    several  other  girls,<br>  especially  when  your 
                    complexion  is  as  dark  as  mine.<br>
                    My  make up  has  been  applied.<br>  My  mum  taught  me  how  to  wear make<br>
                    .</p>
                            <p>sharp eyesight 
                    simmers on dying fire.<br>
                    Your countenance is the light of a fast sinking sun.<br>
                    Muscles of steel now soft like newly ground corn.<br>
                    Humour has abandoned your garden.<br>
                    Where are the mighty hands that lifted me when I fell?<br>
                    Silent weeds strangle years.<br>
                    Tendrils of 
                    life are tangled up and bewildered.
                    Your worm<br></p>
                            <p>eaten garb sways in the wind.<br>
                    My eyes well up and rage weighs my throat down.<br>
                    You are the mahogany never meant to shed his leaves<br></p>
