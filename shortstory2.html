    <body><h1>In the Plantation</h1>
        <p> I still  recall  its  sweetness  when  he  gave  it  to  us.  Uncle  Tom  found  us playing  in  the  banana plantations.  We  were  searching  for nsenene, the  grasshopper  which  appeared  seasonally  when  it rained  in  our  village.  We  searched  for  them  on  the  ground  and  in  the folds  of  the  banana leaves. </p>
        <p>Thefirst time we tasted it was when aunt brought it back from Kampala, “Nakato and Kato come and get some sweets,” she’d cried. We were plucking the legs and wings off nsenenein the backyard of  our  grass-thatched  hut.</p>
        <p>The  sweets  were  different  colours.  I  unwrapped  the  white vuvera, polythene  paper,  from  one  and  threw  it  in  my  mouth.  I  felt  thesticky  honey  sweetness fill my mouth and I swallowed. We ran past Joe’s house to reach  Katumba’s house so that he could taste the nsenene.  Kato  was panting. We wanted to tell Katumba the news quickly and run back home. Mummy didn’t want us playing with Katumba. She said he had bad manners; he liked playing with his male part in front of us. “Katumba,  our  aunt  came  from  Kampala,” Kato told him, from the cool shade where he was seated. He wasplucking the wings and the legs of nsenene</p>
        <p>Kato  was panting. We wanted to tell Katumba the news quickly and run back home. Mummy didn’t want us playing with Katumba. She said he had bad manners; he liked playing with his male part in front of us. “Katumba,  our  aunt  came  from  Kampala,” Kato told him, from the cool shade where he was seated. He wasplucking the wings and the legs of nsenene. The wind was blowing the bananas leaves lightly, swaying them from side to side. “She brought for us some sweet.” Katumba dropped the saucepan  he  was  holding.  Kato  broke  the  sweet,  which  looked  like  a  small  stone, into  two  halves with his teeth and gave one to Katumba, “Eat.” They had been good friends in spite of mummy’s restriction.  Katumba  threw  hishalf  into  his mouth. Then he opened his mouth, his lips moulded, formed to look like a hallway. He was missing two lower teeth which left a path for us to see his tongue rotating.It made us laugh.“It’s sweet,like ripe banana,” said Katumba laughing.“Yes, Aunt Janet said it makes children’s teeth grow,” said Kato.When Katumba heard this he started rubbing asmall remnant of the sweet on his pink gums whichmade us laugh more.</p>
