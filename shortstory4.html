    <body><h1>I Died Alive</h1>
        <p> Walking by the riverside,
            Imagining dark eyes,
            Tiny  fish in Blue Ocean,
            Crocodiles struggling to feed,
            Hippos in the deep,
            Waiting for the night to come.  </p>
        <p>Young Calypso suddenly appeared
            In her flying dress,
            Balancing a water jar
            and singing.</p>
        <p>and singing.
          I tried to stop her just to say, “Hello.”
          The water jar dropped, water flooded the green grass
          Forcefully uprooting and clearing weeds back to river.
          Calypso’s voice rang: “Daddy! 
          Daddy!
          He has raped me.”
          I saw gigantic hands
          Hold me by the throat.</p>
        <p>A man in uniform
           Manacled my hands.
           Three years later
           The man with gigantic
           hands died; he left a letter,
          Urgingme to promise him
            Agrandchild</p>
